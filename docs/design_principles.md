# Design principles

**qtrader** is aimed at those who wish to earn a modest return whilst minimising risk. In trading terms, this translates into researching and trading intraday strategies, maintaining no overnight positions, all with the goal of seeking out [Sharpe ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp).

In building **qtrader**, we tried to abide by the following design principles:

* Code should be as concise as possible while still being readable
* The UI should be optional and lightweight
* Users should be able to run locally or in the cloud (Windows, Mac & Linux)
* Users require little to no knowledge of kdb+ or trading

## Feedback & help
Where we have failed according to these these principles, please tell us at [feedback@alphakdb.com](mailto:alphakdb.com).
